A simple timer app for the busy dad burpee program, move the slider to pick a target and the app will tell you burpees per minute target.

Screenshot below, features to work on...

Workout type, constant or sets with rest
Colour changes for work/rest periods
Buttons for recording your burpees as you work out, I usually use pen and paper!
